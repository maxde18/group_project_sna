Bron triadic closure in politiek",Validatie van hypothese,"Claude: Parties are more likely to vote similarly if they also both vote similarly with a third party. This hypothesis captures triadic closure effects in voting networks, reflecting what Bäck et al. (2023) identify as the ""familiarity mechanism"" in multi-party coalition formation: shared collaboration experience with a third party reduces uncertainty and transaction costs between two parties, making subsequent cooperation more likely. In the Dutch political context, if party A frequently votes with party C, and party B also frequently votes with party C, this shared pattern signals ideological compatibility and reduces the perceived risk of collaboration between A and B. The geometrically weighted edgewise shared partner (GWESP) statistic models this triadic closure process (Schweinberger et al., 2020), down-weighting the marginal contribution of additional shared partners to avoid model degeneracy while capturing the fundamental tendency for voting coalitions to cluster."

k-star 
",Endogeneous,Vera ,Validatie van hypothese. Kunnen we beter gwdegree gebruiken?,"Claude: Some parties collaborate with many other parties across the political spectrum, while others maintain more exclusive voting patterns. This hypothesis reflects the existence of ""pivot parties"" in multi-party systems—parties whose ideological position allows them to bridge different coalition blocs and accumulate more collaboration partners (Casal Bértoa & Enyedi, 2021). In the Dutch context, centrist parties like CDA and D66 have historically functioned as such brokers, maintaining voting similarities with both progressive and conservative blocs. The geometrically weighted degree (gwdegree) statistic tests whether the network exhibits significant heterogeneity in the number of collaboration partners each party maintains (Desmarais & Cranmer, 2012). A positive parameter indicates that some parties systematically occupy more central positions in the voting network than would be expected by chance, functioning as hubs that facilitate broader coalition formation."
