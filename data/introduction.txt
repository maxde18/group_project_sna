Introduction | words
Over the past decades, the Dutch political landscape has become increasingly fragmented. Of the 54 registered parties, 15 currently hold seats in the House of Representatives, hindering formation of stable majority coalitions (Otjes & Louwerse, 2015). The repeated government collapses since 2017 underline this structural tension: as the number of viable parties grows, ideological distances widen, further complicating coalition formation and stability (Schmitt, 2016). This study examines parties’ voting agreement on motions in the 2023-2024 parliamentary cycle. Using social network analysis, it explores both structural voting patterns and the factors shaping them. To do so, the research consists of two complementary studies.
Study 1
This first study examines whether voting agreement between political parties changes between two periods: (a) the year before the 2023 elections and (b) the year after the new cabinet was formed. To explore this, the study answers the following research question:

> RQ1: Is the way Dutch political parties vote differently in motions before elections compared to after cabinet formation?

Previous studies demonstrate that parliamentary voting behavior adapts to political and institutional contexts. Lami et al. (2022) proved that party alignment of the Italian Parliament changed substantially after government transitions, observing differences in cohesion and community structure over time. Additionally, Louwerse et al. (2015) showed that cooperative behavior of government and opposition differ. Cross-party support tends to decline during election campaigns but intensifies after the formation of a new cabinet. These findings present that shifts in political context can lead to different voting behavior. Therefore, the hypothesis for this research question is the following:

> H1.1: Dutch political parties show different levels of voting agreement before elections compared to after cabinet formation. 

Two weighted voting agreement networks will be created, with nodes representing political parties and edge weights indicating the ratio of motions for which two parties voted the same. The first network is based on votes in the year preceding the 2023 elections, and the other based on votes in the year following cabinet formation. To test the first hypothesis, a Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) correlation test will be employed. 


Study 2
The second study focuses on the factors driving voting agreement between Dutch political parties for both networks from Study 1. The research question is:

> RQ2: How do ideological similarity, shared coalition experience, and structural voting patterns influence inter-party agreement on parliamentary motions?

The ideology of a political party reflects its core beliefs and values about how society should function (Corcoran et al., 2020). It is typically measured on a left-right axis, though literature argues that this does not fully capture political orientation (Van Erkel & Turkenbur, 2022), leading to proposals for a bi-dimensional approach (Boräng et al., 2023). In the Dutch context, a second cultural progressive-conservative dimension is widely recognized. However, cultural issues also influence left-right positions (De Vries et al., 2013), suggesting that the two dimensions may be too closely intertwined. Since ideology shapes positions on political issues, it plays a central role in voting behavior. Research repeatedly finds that ideological similarity between parties positively influences their voting similarity (Fowler, 2006; Lo et al., 2023). Therefore, the first hypothesis is:

> H2.1: Parties with similar ideologies on the left-right spectrum are more likely to agree on motions.


Coalition formation is an essential component of government formation. Coalition parties often have to reach agreements to facilitate effective policy-making. Research shows that these agreements are effectively enforced in the Netherlands (Moury & Timmermans, 2013) and that they help parties agree on policy reforms (Bergman et al., 2023). Furthermore, Hahm et al. (2024) show that coalition experience between parties reduces affective polarization in the public opinion. Building on these insights, coalition experience between parties may similarly strengthen party trust and coordination at the parliamentary level. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:

> H2.2: Parties that have often been in a coalition together are more likely to agree on motions.

Relationships between parties can also be understood through broader structural patterns. One such pattern is group formation: parties that frequently vote together tend to do so within larger groups rather than isolated pairs. This can be explained by a familiarity mechanism. When two parties both agree with a third, this shared connection signals ideological compatibility and reduces uncertainty between them (Bäck et al., 2024), increasing the likelihood that they will also agree with each other. As this process repeats across parties, cohesive groups of voting cooperation emerge. The following hypothesis is proposed:

> H2.3: Parties are more likely to agree on motions if they share agreement on motions with a third party.

Structural difference also lies in parties' overall voting similarity with others. Some parties show high voting agreement with many parties across the political spectrum, while others maintain more exclusive voting patterns. Research indicates that certain parties function as important intermediaries in parliamentary voting, as they are able to cooperate with a wide range of political actors (Del Vicario et al, 2014). In Dutch politics, centrist parties like CDA and D66 have historically functioned as such intermediaries. Conversely, populist parties tend to maintain isolated voting patterns, avoiding the compromises necessary for broad voting coalitions (Otjes & Louwerse, 2017). Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:

> H2.4: Some parties are more likely to agree with many other parties.


The creation of motions is frequently performed by several MP’s working in conjunction together, an approach called co-sponsorship. MP’s introduce resolutions and amendments across party boundaries with those MP’s who specialize in similar topics (Otjes & Louwerse, 2015). MP’s frequently tend to co-sponsor bills to signal approval for a motion (Kessler & Krehbiel 1996). This agreement can originate from coalition membership as well as ideological similarity (Otjes & Louwerse, 2015). Since voting unity within parties is almost 100% in Dutch politics (Andeweg & Irwin, 2009) co-sponsorship behaviour at MP level can be abstracted to the party level and results in the following hypothesis:

>H2.5 Parties who frequently co-sponsor motions tend to agree more with each other


RQ2 will be answered using a GERGM, using terms depicted in table 1.

This research contributes to the existing body of literature by integrating structural network analysis with traditional political measures of ideology and coalition experience. It advances understanding of Dutch parliamentary voting patterns by identifying parties that act as key intermediaries, and provides empirical evidence about heterogeneity in party agreement patterns. Furthermore, it provides insights about how voting agreement is impacted by elections and coalition formation.

Chapter 2 and 3 will detail the data used for this research and the adopted research rationale, respectively. Chapter 4 shows the results for the two studies. Lastly, chapter 5 will formulate the conclusions and answer the research questions, also suggesting directions for future research.


Hypotheses
GERGM Term
Motivation
H2.1: Parties with similar ideologies on the left-right spectrum are more likely to agree on motions.
absdiff(LeftVSRight)
The term absdiff measures how differences between node (i.e. party) attributes impact tie formation, capturing how differences in ideology impact voting agreement.
H2.2: Parties that have often been in a coalition together are more likely to agree on motions.
edgecov(coalitioncount)
The edgecov term measures how ties in a different setting impact tie formation. In the context of this research, a count variable for how many times parties have been in a coalition together will be used to capture its effect on voting agreement.
H2.3: Parties are more likely to agree on motions if they share agreement on motions with a third party.
gwesp
Gwesp captures the tendency for parties with shared agreement for a third country to vote the same.
H2.4:  Some parties are more likely to agree with many other parties.
kstar(3) 
The kstar(3) term captures the tendency for some parties to form broader patterns of cooperation by agreeing with many others. Specifically, 3-star specifically reflects parties that maintain multiple voting agreements at once, identifying those that function as broad intermediaries.
H2.5: Parties who frequently co-sponsor motions tend to agree more with each other


edgecov(cosponsor_count)
The edgecov term adds a dyadic predictor to the model. Here, a matrix counting how often each pair of parties co-sponsored motions is used to test whether co-sponsorship frequency increases voting agreement.
