# Electoral Cycle Network Analysis: Dutch Parliament 2023-2024

## Research Question

**Do co-voting patterns between parties change across the electoral cycle?**

---

## Study Design

| Period | Timeframe | Event |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Far from Election** | Q1+Q2 2023 | Normal operations (Rutte IV) |
| **Close to Election** | Q3+Q4 2023 | **Election: Nov 22, 2023** |
| **Post Formation** | Q3+Q4 2024 | **New cabinet: July 2, 2024** (Schoof I) |

## Quick Start

### Run Main Analysis (Z-Score Normalized)
```bash
Rscript scripts/three_period_network_analysis_normalized.R
```

**Key output:** `results/visualizations/network_comparison_normalized.pdf`

### Generate Full Statistics
```bash
Rscript scripts/generate_network_statistics.R
```

**Key output:** `results/statistics/comprehensive_network_statistics.csv`

## Methodology

### Network Construction
- **Nodes:** Political parties
- **Edges:** Co-voting ties (min 5 shared votes)
- **Weight:** Number of agreements between parties

### Z-Score Normalization

**Why?** Post-formation has 65% fewer votes → raw counts incomparable

**Solution:** Standardize within each period: `z = (weight - mean) / sd`

**Result:** Compare cooperation **patterns** not just volumes

**Interpretation:**
- `z > 1.0`: Strong tie (above average)
- `z > 2.0`: Very strong tie (top ~2%)

## Political Science Interpretation

### Why Cooperation Dips Before Elections

1. **Electoral differentiation**: Parties need to distinguish themselves
2. **Base signaling**: Core voters want parties to "stand firm"
3. **Coalition bargaining**: Avoid appearing "too cozy" to maintain leverage
4. **Campaign mode**: Focus shifts from governance to position-taking

### Why Structure Improves Post-Formation

1. **Governance imperative**: New coalition must pass legislation
2. **Selective cooperation**: Fewer votes but more focused partnerships
3. **Complete integration**: All parties connected (100% density)
